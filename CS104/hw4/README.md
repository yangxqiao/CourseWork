### Problem 2, 4, 5, 6, 7:

<p> type "make" to compile</p>

<p> problem 2 has test files: input.txt, output.txt </p>

<p> problem 6 has test file: stack_test.cpp </p>

<p> I put the compile command of stack_test.cpp in the Makefile, so the stack_test.cpp could be compiled by the 'make' command </p>
