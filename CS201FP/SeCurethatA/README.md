# What it’s for:
* Help you make a better course selection by 
  * looking up average GPA for certain term with a certain professor
  * Seeing if taking a certain course with a certain professor is recommended by past students
  * Seeing if a certain course with a certain professor is challenging rated by past students
* Help you decide which corresponding course to choose

# What works:
* Showing search results to users intuitively by professors or by classes
* Recommending higher-level classes
* Presenting the distributions through google chart API
* User upload not recorded to protect privacy

# What doesn’t work:
* No limitation for a user’s upload, so a user can rate a course more than once
* No email or phone verifications, so everyone can create an account and use the website
